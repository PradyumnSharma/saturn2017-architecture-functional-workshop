Interested in exploring functional programming ideas and software
architecture?  Here is how you can become a participant in the
workshop:

1. Prepare a brief "position paper" containing your ideas, questions, and experiences and submit it to the workshop by forking this workshop repository in GitHub and issuing a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your position paper included.
2. You will be contacted via the pull request by the workshop organizers regarding acceptance into the workshop.  To reserve your spot you should submit a reasonable first draft as soon as possible, no later than April 16.
3. Once you are confirmed for the workshop, if you have not already, [register for the SATURN 2017 conference](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/registration.cfm).

Final drafts of position papers are due by April 16, 2017.

## Position Papers

What should be included in your position paper?  A variety of possible
ideas could be appropriate.  [See the list of thinking questions to
help get you started](/questions.md).  The main point of a position
paper is to create a starting off point for planning workshop
activities.

Some ideas for what to put in a position paper:
* **Write a pattern**.  TODO more guidance.
* Explain a **personal experience** - positive and/or negative.
* Describe some **specific problems** that you've encountered when designing or building systems that might have been caused by (or perhaps could be solved by) adopting containers.
* Describe some of your own **philosophy** regarding architecture thinking or software design to contribute to the discussion.
* **Ask some questions** -- What are you most curious or concerned or excited or confused or ... about architecting within the context of a containerized world?  Oftentimes a good question is more valuable than 100 answers.

All workshop material will be published to the GitHub repository
including write-ups, images, and position papers.  You can see the
[outcomes from the SATURN 2016 workshop for a taste of what this one
will be
like](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/saturn2016-containers-workshop).
