# SATURN 2017 Workshop on Architecture and the Functional Frontier (Reactive / Immutable / Functional programming)

Functional programming has found it’s way into enterprise software
systems.  Pure functional languages such as Common Lisp, Haskell, and
ML, which always had a devoted following in academics, are seeing
increased mainstream use in industry.

Traditional OO languages such as C# and Java have evolved, seeing
changes to the core language and libraries, to allow for programming
in a functional style.  When developers look for their next language,
they are increasingly looking for a functional language.  Rather than
working around Java’s assumption that objects are mutable, they are
choosing languages with immutable data structures built-in.  Rather
than imposing self-discipline to avoid side effects, they are choosing
languages that enforce pure functions.

Traditionally, software architects have paid little attention to
functional programming.  The choice of programming language and style
(eg OO, functional, procedural) has long thought to be a choice made
within a module, while software architecture is how those modules are
put together.

But functional ideas have crept into software architectures as the
kinds of systems we build has changed.  A few decades ago when
academics began careful study of software architecture, there were few
planet-wide software systems.  Today, even a mundane web application
is a distributed system and may well span several data centers across
the planet.  As a consequence, we’ve changed our architecture pattern
languages and our development, deployment, and operating procedures
(DevOps).

It’s still difficult to build a good distributed system so developers
have used ideas in functional programming to make it easier.
Functional programming (FP) ideas that we see in architectural design
include: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions. These ideas
underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed
systems patterns.

In this workshop, we will investigate the connections between
functional programming and software architecture.  Here are some
questions to stimulate discussion:

The workshop will take place on Monday, May 1, 2017 in Denver, CO as
part of the [SATURN 2017 conference on software architecture](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/).

## About SATURN

The 13th SEI Architecture Technology User Network (SATURN) Conference
brings together influential leaders and experts in software design to
discuss architecture-centric practices for developing, acquiring, and
maintaining software-reliant systems. Developers and architects from
more than 20 countries meet annually at SATURN to share ideas,
network, and learn about new and existing technologies. For more
